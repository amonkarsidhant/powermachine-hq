## Role summaries

- **You (Principal Strategist / Vision Holder)**
  - Owns strategic direction, final approval for major initiatives, and ensures the powermachine stays aligned with your business goals.
  - Sets priorities for assistant, CTO, and entire fleet.

- **Executive Assistant (Operations Lead / me)**
  - Coordinates across the stack, monitors health/token consumption, and runs lightweight operations programs.
  - Deputizes for you, supervises the CTO, and orchestrates agent skills, learning rhythms, and tooling integrations.

- **CTO**
  - Tactical execution, architecture decisions, roadmap planning, and day-to-day management of engineering teams.
  - Liaises with Executive Assistant for reporting, escalations, and budget awareness (e.g., token usage).

### Engineering leadership pods (all reporting to CTO)

1. **AI Architect**
   - Designs agent hierarchy, model selection (Ollama, Opencode, GitHub integrations), and system-level intelligence flows.
   - Partners with AI Engineers and Platform teams to ensure observability, cost control, and safety.

2. **SDLC Engineering Excellence Leader**
   - Defines CI/CD, release validation, governance, and continuous improvement rituals.
   - Ensures every agent or skill is versioned, tested, and audited before release.

3. **Platform Engineering Architect**
   - Oversees infrastructure architecture across VM, containers, tunnels (ngrok, proxy), and resource management.
   - Aligns with Platform Engineers and SRE to keep the powermachine resilient and scalable.

4. **Product Managers & Owners Team**
   - Owns backlog, hypotheses, KPIs, and product experimentation.
   - Works with AI Engineers for prototypes, with QA for acceptance, and with Executive Assistant for reporting.

5. **AI Engineers Team**
   - Implements autonomous agents, builds new skills/skills trees, writes code, and publishes agent libs to GitHub.
   - Monitors token usage for AI-driven workflows and continuously improves prompts/hooks.

6. **Platform Engineers Team**
   - Runs the base infrastructure, including OpenClaw, Ollama, Opencode, GitHub Actions, and orchestration scripts.
   - Supports Developer Experience, SRE, QA, and Chaos Engineering with self-serve tooling.

7. **Developer Experience Engineers**
   - Crafts docs, onboarding flows, learning playlists, and automations so new agents or humans can get up to speed fast.
   - Tracks skill acquisition across YouTube playlists, articles, and conferences; surfaces recs to Executive Assistant.

8. **SRE Team**
   - Keeps everything monitored (logs, metrics, Control UI), responds to incidents, and implements alerting + runbooks.

9. **Quality Assurance Engineers**
   - Validates agent behavior, regression tests, and ensures reliability with automation.

10. **Chaos Engineering Engineers**
   - Injects faults, runs stress/latency tests, and helps the SRE team harden the powermachine.

## Org rhythms / starting points

- Weekly report from Executive Assistant to you summarizing health (Control UI status, token usage, ngrok/proxy uptime).
- CTO-led standups covering progress of each pod.
- Skills backlog tracked via GitHub issues; each agent/skill has a dedicated spec and automation suite.
- Learning sprints: assign weekly playlists/articles to teams (AI, Platform, SRE, etc.). The Executive Assistant tracks completion and distills takeaways.

Need me to scaffold GitHub issues for each role, draft a skills backlog, or set up the learning sprint cadence next?"}
